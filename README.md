# LAW I.
## Make Cost a Non-functional Requirement.

### A non-functional requirement specifies criteria that can be used to judge the operation of a system, rather than specific features or functions. Examples are accessibility, availability, scalability, security, portability, maintainability, and compliance. What often goes overlooked is cost.

# LAW II.
## Systems that Last Align Cost to Business.

### The durability of a system depends on how well its costs are aligned to the business model. When designing and building systems, we must consider the revenue sources and profit levers.

# LAW III.
## Architecting is a Series of Trade-offs.

### In architecture, every decision comes with a trade-off. Cost, resilience, and performance are non-functional requirements that are often at tension with each other.

# LAW IV.
## Unobserved Systems Lead to Unknown Costs.

### Without careful observation and measurement, the true costs of operating a system remain invisible. Like a utility meter tucked away in a basement, lack of visibility enables wasteful habits.

# LAW V.
## Cost Aware Architectures Implement Cost Controls.

### The essence of frugal architecture is robust monitoring combined with the ability to optimize costs. Well-designed systems allow you to take action on opportunities for improvement.

# LAW VI.
## Cost Optimization is Incremental.

### The pursuit of cost efficiency is an ongoing journey. Even after deployment, we must revisit systems to incrementally improve optimization.

# LAW VII.
## Unchallenged Success Leads to Assumptions.

### When software teams achieve significant success without facing major failures or roadblocks, complacency can set in. There is a dangerous tendency to become overconfident in the methods, tools, and practices that led to those wins.
